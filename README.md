Yoga_Cloud
====================

Using Twitter's API, this simple app will take a select group of Twitter users and output the most commonly used words from their recent tweets using the [d3-cloud](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud) layout.

In this sample case we are pulling biographical data from top Twitter contributors in the online Yoga-sphere. 

Much of the net/HTTP code draws from the [Codecademy](www.codecademy.com) Twitter API lessons. The site has some great tutorials, check them out!
