Yoga_Cloud
====================

This project gathers the Twitter bios of a select group of contributors in the online Yoga-sphere and outputs a random selection of their most commonly used words using [d3-cloud](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud).

Much of the net/HTTP code draws from the [Codecademy](www.codecademy.com) Twitter API lessons. The site has some great tutorials, check them out!
