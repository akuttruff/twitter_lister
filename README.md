Yoga_Cloud
====================

Using Twitter's API, this simple app will take a select group of Twitter users and output the most commonly used words from their recent tweets. 

In this sample case we are pulling information from top Twitter contributors in the online Yoga-sphere. 

(This is also my first time playing around with an API.)

Much of the net/HTTP code draws from the [Codecademy](www.codecademy.com) Twitter API lessons. The site has some great tutorials, check them out!
