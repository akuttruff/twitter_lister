Twitter_Lister
====================

![alt tag](https://github.com/akuttruff/twitter_lister/blob/master/wordcloud.png)

My very first project plays with the developer-friendly [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs) to create data visualizations rendered by the [d3-cloud](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud) JavaScript library. It's a small Sinatra application written in Ruby and hosted by Heroku:

Much of the net/HTTP code draws from the [Codecademy](www.codecademy.com) Twitter API lessons.

It's terribly redundant and lengthy, but it's the first application I ever wired together, and so I'll leave it up like a kindergartner's crayon drawing on the fridge.
