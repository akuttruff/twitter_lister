Twitter_Lister
====================

My first project plays with the developer-friendly [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs) to create data visualizations rendered by the [d3-cloud](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud) JavaScript library. It's a small Sinatra application written in Ruby and hosted by Heroku:

Much of the net/HTTP code draws from the [Codecademy](www.codecademy.com) Twitter API lessons. 

To Do:
====================

- Lister.process needs to be refactored
